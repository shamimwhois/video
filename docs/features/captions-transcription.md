# Captions and transcription — Detailed Feature Specification

**Product:** AI Video Studio | **Domain:** Captions and transcription | **Priority:** P1 professional creator workflow
**Requirement range:** VS-0505 through VS-0546

## Domain purpose
Speech recognition, caption tracks, editing, timing, styling, translation, export, and accessibility.

## Domain-wide engineering constraints
- The domain must use canonical project identifiers and enforce workspace/resource authorization on the server.
- Mutations must be validated, transactional where applicable, and represented in versioned project state.
- Source media remains immutable; derived media and outputs must retain provenance and lifecycle metadata.
- Asynchronous work must be idempotent, observable, bounded, and recoverable; progress must reflect measured work.
- UI controls must expose loading, empty, disabled, success, and error states as applicable.
- All user-visible behavior must be keyboard accessible and documented; unsupported paths must fail clearly.

## Detailed requirements

### VS-0505 — Captions and transcription: create
**Requirement.** Create with validated defaults and a stable identifier. Apply this capability to speech recognition, caption tracks, editing, timing, styling, translation, export, and accessibility.
**User workflow.** The user enters the relevant workspace and domain view, selects the target resource, invokes the action, reviews the result, and receives a clear persisted outcome. Bulk or asynchronous variants must identify the affected resources.
**Interface behavior.** Provide a discoverable control, contextual help, field-level validation, disabled/loading states, confirmation for destructive actions, and a clear success or failure message. Preserve keyboard focus and selection after completion.
**Domain state.** Persist stable resource IDs, ownership, workspace scope, schema version, actor, timestamps, and relevant state transitions. Avoid storing transient UI state as canonical domain data.
**Service/API behavior.** Validate the request server-side, authorize the actor against the target resource, execute through a domain service, return a versioned response, and emit domain events only after successful commit.
**Validation/security.** Reject malformed, stale, unsupported, over-quota, cross-tenant, or unauthorized requests. Sanitize user-controlled text, protect secrets, and apply idempotency keys to retryable operations.
**Failure/recovery.** On failure, preserve the last valid state, return an actionable error code, record a correlation ID, and offer retry only when the operation is safe to repeat. Partial batch outcomes must be explicit.
**Observability.** Record success/failure counts, latency, actor/workspace identifiers, operation type, and correlation IDs. Never log raw credentials, private media URLs, or sensitive user content.
**Acceptance tests.** Cover the valid workflow, invalid payload, unauthorized actor, cross-workspace access, duplicate/retry request, persistence after reload, and recoverable service failure.

### VS-0541 — Captions and transcription: privacy
**Requirement.** Enforce explicit sharing, retention, consent, and deletion behavior. Apply this capability to speech recognition, caption tracks, editing, timing, styling, translation, export, and accessibility.
**User workflow.** The user enters the relevant workspace and domain view, selects the target resource, invokes the action, reviews the result, and receives a clear persisted outcome. Bulk or asynchronous variants must identify the affected resources.
**Interface behavior.** Provide a discoverable control, contextual help, field-level validation, disabled/loading states, confirmation for destructive actions, and a clear success or failure message. Preserve keyboard focus and selection after completion.
**Domain state.** Persist stable resource IDs, ownership, workspace scope, schema version, actor, timestamps, and relevant state transitions. Avoid storing transient UI state as canonical domain data.
**Service/API behavior.** Validate the request server-side, authorize the actor against the target resource, execute through a domain service, return a versioned response, and emit domain events only after successful commit.
**Validation/security.** Reject malformed, stale, unsupported, over-quota, cross-tenant, or unauthorized requests. Sanitize user-controlled text, protect secrets, and apply idempotency keys to retryable operations.
**Failure/recovery.** On failure, preserve the last valid state, return an actionable error code, record a correlation ID, and offer retry only when the operation is safe to repeat. Partial batch outcomes must be explicit.
**Observability.** Record success/failure counts, latency, actor/workspace identifiers, operation type, and correlation IDs. Never log raw credentials, private media URLs, or sensitive user content.
**Acceptance tests.** Cover the valid workflow, invalid payload, unauthorized actor, cross-workspace access, duplicate/retry request, persistence after reload, and recoverable service failure.

## Domain acceptance gate

- All requirement IDs in this domain have explicit implementation status in CURRENT_STATE.md.
- Authorization, validation, data integrity, and recovery tests pass.
- UI behavior is verified at supported viewport sizes and keyboard-only operation.
- Operational metrics and runbook references exist for asynchronous or critical workflows.
- No requirement is marked Implemented or Verified solely because it is documented.
